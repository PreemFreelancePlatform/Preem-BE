# PREEM-BE:
This is the backend for Preem. The better freelance platform. I never liked the idea of how other freelance platforms "Vet" their devs based on numbers vs actual work and talent. I always thought the best people the decide who and who doesnt have what it takes are our fellow peers. Not only do i want to create a platform that has an intuitive new age functionlaites like real time job tracking and (name some more cool things this app could have) i aim to create a peer review system in which it decides who and who does nt get to do jobs on the platform. the idea is not to be an asshole and gatekeep but to ensure the clients of preem are delviered INCREDIBLE WORK. every. single. time
